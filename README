&&: AND
||: OR
!==: NOT
===: precise equal to
==: fuzzy equal to
i++: increments variable by 1
i--: decreases variable by 1
i+=2: increments variable by number after '=' (in this case it would add 2)
i-=5 decreases variable by number after '=' (int his case it would subtract 5)



Conditional logic, loops, arrays, pair programming, GitHub

You can't use 'AND' or 'OR' in JS (has to be && and ||)

For loop takes in 3 separate arguments (iterator variable declaration, condition to exit loop, incrementing iterator)

for(let i = 0; i < 5; i++){


}

for(statement1; statement2; statement3){

//code to execute during loop

}


if(condition){

//code to execute if condition is met

}else if{

//code to execute if condition is met

}else{

//code to execute if no conditions are met

}
